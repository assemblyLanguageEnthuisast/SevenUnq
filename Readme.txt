# SevenUnq

**A teachable narration engine for VB.NET.**  
It doesn’t just run—it shows you exactly what it’s doing.

## 🔍 What It Does

SevenUnq narrates code execution line-by-line, offering:
- **Pre- and post-execution commentary** for every step
- **Modular narration layers** that scale across arrays and logic blocks
- **Keypress-controlled pacing** for runtime clarity
- **Resilient logging and recovery scaffolding**
- **Authorial insight** woven into commentary, when needed

## 🧠 Philosophy

Built for developers who want to avoid carpal tunnel.  
SevenUnq favors **clarity over cleverness**, **literal truth over abstraction**, and **teachability over polish**.  
It narrates what’s happening so you can physically see the program run—without scrolling, guessing, or chasing breakpoints.

This engine respects your wrists and your time.  
It pauses when you need it to, speaks only when it’s useful, and remembers what you shouldn’t have to.

## 🛠️ Features

- Narration modules that plug into any VB.NET program
- Quote-detection and atomic narration logic
- UI commentary layers (GroupBox3 and GroupBox4) for parallel insight
- Simple, narratable control systems—no scripting required

## 🚧 Status

Currently in active development.  
Recent breakthroughs include:
- Transition from frequency-based to line-based narration
- Integration of author’s voice into commentary
- Keypress routines for runtime pacing
